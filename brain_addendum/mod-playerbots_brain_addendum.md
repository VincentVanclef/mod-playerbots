# mod-playerbots RTG queue addendum

## Patch focus

This patch corrects battleground acquisition phase ordering so that startup queues are fulfilled before finish-fill growth on already-running battlegrounds.

## Problem observed

When one battleground had already launched and entered `finish_fill`, the acquisition sorter still prioritized `finish_fill` buckets ahead of a second battleground still in `pop_or_invite`.

That caused the first battleground to keep asking for expansion bots while the second battleground remained below launch threshold.

## Formula correction

BG phase priority is now:

1. `pop_or_invite`
2. `starter_fill`
3. `live_refill`
4. `finish_fill`

Additionally, when any BG bucket still has startup demand (`pop_or_invite` or `starter_fill`), `finish_fill` buckets are suppressed for that acquisition pass.

## Intent

- launch waiting battlegrounds before enlarging already-running ones
- preserve live-refill behavior
- stop first-BG finish-fill growth from starving second-BG startup
